I also uploaded this small assignement with the psuedocode I've written to show some of the thought process I go through at this point in my development. 

Generally, I "thumbnail" the assignement with a flowchart, then translate that into pseudocode before messing with the syntax in the editor proper. I find pseudo is a great way to find more elegant solutions to issues ahead of time, especially when I'm learning(like implementing an array instead of an overlong switch statement).
